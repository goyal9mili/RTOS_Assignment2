THE GROUP CHAT PROGRAM

This involves the client and server codes that have been uploaded.

1) Run the Server
2) Create multiple clients and have a group chat
3) use "EXIT" to end the chat. :)

There is the option to perform the individual chat or the group chat....
For that :

when you send a message, you will be asked to enter the kind of message you want to send...

Eneter 'G' for group and 'D' for DM

If you have selected 'D'......you will be asked for the id of the user...Enter the id and you are done!!!
